## Introduction

The *HelpDesk System* is a web-based platform that simplifies technical problem-solving for students. Users can raise issues, find solutions, vote on helpful answers, and track responses. It supports tags for easy filtering by language, learning stage, or technical challenge. With API-driven functionality, it fosters seamless integration and a collaborative learning community.

## Problem Statement

Students often encounter recurring challenges and struggle to find quick, relevant solutions. Repeating efforts can be frustrating and inefficient, and navigating solutions can be difficult.

## Solution

The *HelpDesk System* addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly platform where students can:
- Raise issues they encounter.
- Post solutions to problems.
- Vote on solutions based on their usefulness.
- Tag problems and solutions to make them easily searchable.
- Keep track of solutions and answers in an organized, efficient manner.
- Receive notifications about new responses, votes, and answers.

The system will help reduce redundancy, encourage collaboration, and enhance the learning experience for all users.

## User Stories
